# Vote counting in Blockchain based voting system
Currently with EVMs, we have to wait days before all the EVMs are collected to respective central points and then manually each of the EVM individually has to be connected to the main computer and then votes are counted, resulting in a very expensive process both in terms of money and time.

Using Blockchain, we will be able to count the votes very quickly(within muinutes) of finishing the elections with the added transparency as well.

## A basic blockchain voting system
Our project is mainly concerned with the counting of votes, but we here sketch the outline of how we garner the rest of the system looks like.

The basic voting system either will record the votes through a local node or even a mobile device for each individual.Each of the vote is recorded as a transaction in the blockchain underneath. All the votes/transactions registered finally by the blockchain have been verified and are valid. The blockchain is public meaning anyone can join as a node and verify the legitimacy of the network and database by applying the transactions.
